Built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)**, the system stores all data in `localStorage`, requiring no backend or external database.  
Despite being lightweight, it delivers the functionality of a complete management platform.

The project aims to provide a **modern, fast, and intuitive** interface for both students and administrators, featuring real-time updates, accurate meal tracking, smart billing automation, and professional reporting tools.
